# p-linnane's unsigned casks

## What are these casks?

Homebrew requires applications to be signed. This is a a collection of casks that are not signed, but still useful. Since the applications are unsigned, it's advised to pass `--no-quarantine` when running `brew install`.

## Current list of casks:

* `ryujinx`: Nintendo Switch emulator

## How do I install these casks?

`brew install p-linnane/unsigned/<cask>`

Or `brew tap p-linnane/unsigned` and then `brew install --cask --no-quarantine <cask>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
